WelcometotheMatchingGameProject!
Your task is to create an engaging matching game using React.js with TypeScript,
following the design provided in Figma. In this game, players will test their memory
and skills by matching items within a defined number of tries, with a set limit. Upon
successful matches, players will collect a banana, which will be prominently
displayed on the final screen. Data for the game can be dynamically sourced from
either a JSON file or a database. It's essential to use TypeScript to define the
necessary data structures, ensuring all required key fields are properly integrated.
