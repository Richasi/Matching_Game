Matching Game Project
Welcome to the Matching Game Project!
Your task is to create an engaging matching game using React.js with TypeScript, following the design provided in Figma. In this game, players will test their memory and skills by matching items within a defined number of tries, with a set limit. Upon successful matches, players will collect a banana, which will be prominently displayed on the final screen. Data for the game can be dynamically sourced from either a JSON file or a database. It's essential to use TypeScript to define the necessary data structures, ensuring all required key fields are properly integrated.
